    <p class="percentInfo">60% of the people in Somalia suffer from malnutrition. At least 1.5 million children under five are acutely malnourished across Somalia, with more than 385,000 children at risk of dying without immediate care. For 6 years Somalia has recevied no rain due to climate change and because of this the crops die. This is the root cause of the food crisis there. Many Somali children are not getting enough food, both in terms of quantity and variety. High number of these children and their mothers suffer from anaemia and vitamin A deficiency. They are also more susceptible to infectious diseases and at risk of developing severe acute malnutrition â€“ dangerously low weight and severe muscle wasting. When acute malnutrition becomes severe, children can die. Globally, 45 percent of all child deaths are associated with malnutrition.</p>
